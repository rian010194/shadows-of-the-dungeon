## 🎮 How the Game Works

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs up/in via Supabase Auth
2. Profile created in database
3. Stats tracked (games played, wins)

### Matchmaking Flow
1. Player clicks "Find Multiplayer Game"
2. System searches for waiting lobbies
3. If found: Join existing lobby
4. If not: Create new lobby
5. Real-time updates as players join
6. After 30 seconds OR when host starts:
   - Game begins with real players
   - Remaining slots filled with AI

### Game Modes
- **Single Player**: Local game with AI only
- **Multiplayer**: Mix of real players + AI fill
